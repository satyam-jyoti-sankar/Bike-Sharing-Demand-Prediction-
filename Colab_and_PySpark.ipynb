        "\n",
        "<b>Cluster</b> is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Hadoop</b> is an open source, scalable, and fault tolerant framework written in Java. It efficiently processes large volumes of data on a cluster of commodity hardware. Hadoop is not only a storage system but is a platform for large data storage as well as processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>HDFS</b> (Hadoop distributed file system). It is one of the world's most reliable storage system. HDFS is a Filesystem of Hadoop designed for storing very large files running on a cluster of commodity hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>MapReduce</b> is a data Processing framework, which has 2 phases - Mapper and Reducer. The map procedure performs filtering and sorting, and the reduce method performs a summary operation. It usually runs on a hadoop cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Transformation</b> refers to the operations applied on a dataset to create a new dataset. Filter, groupBy and map are the examples of transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Actions</b> Actions refer to an operation which instructs Spark to perform computation and send the result back to driver. This is an example of action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright! Now that that's out of the way, let me explain how a spark job runs. In simple terma, each time you submit a pyspark job, the code gets internally converted into a MapReduce program and gets executed in the Java virtual machine. Now one of the thoughts that might be popping in your mind will probably be: <br>`So the code gets converted into a MapReduce program. Wouldn't that mean MapReduce is faster than pySpark?`<br> Well, the answer is a big NO. This is what makes spark jobs special. Spark is capable of handling a massive amount of data at a time, in it's distributed environment. It does this through <u>in-memory processing</u>, which is what makes it almost 100 times faster than Hadoop. Another factor which amkes it fast is <u>Lazy Evaluation</u>. Spark delays its evaluation as much as it can. Each time you  submit a job, spark creates an action plan for how to execute the code, and then does nothing. Finally, when you ask for the result(i.e, calls an action), it executes the plan, which is basically all the transofrmations you have mentioned in your code. That's basically the gist of it. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now lastly, I want to talk about on more thing. Spark mainly consists of 4 modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "<ol>\n",
        "    <li>Spark SQL - helps to write  spark programs using SQL like queries.</li>\n",
        "    <li>Spark Streaming - is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. used heavily in processing of social media data.</li>\n",
        "    <li>Spark MLLib - is the machine learning component of SPark. It helps train ML models on massive datasets with very high efficeny. </li>\n",
        "    <li>Spark GraphX - is the visualization component of Spark. It enables users to view data both as graphs and as collections without data movement or duplication.</li>\n",

The Python worker consumes huge off-heap memory and so it often leads to memoryOverhead, thereby failing your job.

        "3. The driver then broadcasts the combined dataset (full copy) into each executor.\n",
        "4. The size of the broadcasted dataset could be several (10-20+) times bigger the input in memory due to factors like deserialization.\n",
        "5. Executors will end up storing the parts it read first, and also the full copy, thereby leading to a high memory requirement.\n",
